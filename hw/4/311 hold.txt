G is an undirected graph with r-clique. r is the size of said clique\\ triangle has an r value of 3 here. We also have the graph $G=(V,E)$ where V is the vertices, E is the edges and G is the graph. \\n = |V| (num vertices)\\m = |E| (num edges)\\Enumerating the triplet (x,y,z) where $x,y,z\epsilon V$ \\If G contains the edges of the triangle that has $(x,y), (y,z), and (x,z)$ are edges within G, then return true, if not then return false.\\There are $\binom{n}{3} = \Theta (n^3)$ triplets that can be formed from the vertices within G. These triplets can be enumerated within O($n^3$) time and to check if all the edges of a triplet belong to set E will take O(m) time\\The total time with both attributes together will take $O(n^3*m) or O(|V|^3*|E|)$ which is polynomial, therefore $3-ANGLE \epsilon P$
