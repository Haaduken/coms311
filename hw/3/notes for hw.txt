    Bottom up approach
    0-m
    0-n

    store depth of moves in the index of a 2d matrix

    ex
    3 of m, 3 of n would be 2 moves from a win
    how far from last move - depth is distance from win

    index 3,3 -> 2 moves remaining
    last index of [m][n] if even, A wins, if odd, B wins

    set index to [infinity] b/c if at end if the index is infinity, there is no winning strat
    runtime of O(m*n)

    runtime of O(2N*B)
